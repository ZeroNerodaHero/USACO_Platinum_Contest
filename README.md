# USACO_Platinum_Contest
### Solutions to USACO Platinum problems. 

As a Platinum contestant, I have to define new concepts sometimes. In Circus (USACO 2020 Open) problem, new definitions are given for virtual connected component and chain in order to describe my algorithm. The connected component (CC) is somewhat similar to but also different from connected component in graph.  It defines one domain where two cows could swap their positions.  The chain is like one weighted edge in tree or graph, which connects but also segments CCs. Similar to Boruvkaâ€™s algorithm, the algorithm is to merge CCs by removing or hiding chains when there are enough unoccupied vertices.  Here is the detailed description.
